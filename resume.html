<h2>&#9998; Skills</h2>
<hr>
<p>The only skill I believe I excel at is <strong>taking initiative</strong>.</p>
<p>There are other skills I have learned like: 
    <ul>
        <li>Coding (HTML + CSS)</li>
        <li>Copywriting (used on my main webpage)</li>
        <li>Sound design (used for YouTube)</li>
        <li>Singing (used for YouTube + hobby)</li>
    </ul>
But I am far from mastering any of them. What excites me is the scope of improvement in each field. It's a never ending journey of self-improvement and that provides the motivation I need to start taking action.
